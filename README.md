# Employee Tracker

## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, we were to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
  
This command-line application allows the user to:
  * Add departments, roles, employees
  * View departments, roles, employees
  * Update employee roles
